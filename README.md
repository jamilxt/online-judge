## 📱 Mobile & Desktop Apps

Looking for the Android or Desktop version? We have a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** app that connects to this backend!

👉 **[Go to CodeJudge KMP Repo](https://github.com/jamilxt/online-judge-kmp)**

## 📖 What is an Online Judge?

An **online judge** is a system that:
1. Shows you a programming problem (like "add two numbers")
2. Lets you write code to solve it
3. Runs your code against test cases
4. Tells you if your solution is correct ✅ or wrong ❌

---

## 🎯 What Can You Do With This?

- ✅ Browse programming problems (Easy, Medium difficulty)
- ✅ Write code in **Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, or C**
- ✅ Submit your code and see instant results
- ✅ See which test cases passed or failed
- ✅ Practice coding in a beautiful dark-themed editor

## 🛠️ Requirements

### Must Have (All Platforms):
| Software | Why You Need It | How to Check |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Java 17+** | Runs the server | `java -version` |
| **Maven** | Builds the project | `mvn -version` |

### For Running Code - Choose One Mode:

#### Option A: Local Mode (easier to set up)

<details>
<summary><b>🪟 Windows</b></summary>

| Language | How to Install |
|----------|----------------|
| Python | [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - check "Add to PATH" |
| Java | Already included with Java 17 |
| C/C++ | [Download MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) or use Visual Studio |
| Node.js | [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐧 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)</b></summary>

```bash
sudo apt install python3 gcc g++ nodejs
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🍎 macOS</b></summary>

```bash
brew install python3 gcc node
```

</details>

#### Option B: Docker Mode (more secure)

📖 **[Read the Full Docker Setup Guide →](DOCKER_GUIDE.md)**

Quick links:
| Platform | How to Install |
|----------|----------------|
| Windows | [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) |
| Linux | [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) |
| macOS | [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) |

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Terminal/Command Prompt
Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd path/to/online-judge
```

### Step 2: Run the Application

**On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
```cmd
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Wait until you see:
```
Started OnlineJudgeApplication in X seconds
Initialized 5 sample problems
```

### Step 3: Open Your Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:8081**

### Step 4: Solve a Problem!
1. Click on any problem (like "Two Sum")
2. Write your code in the editor
3. Click **Submit**
4. See if you got **ACCEPTED** ✅

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The main configuration file is `src/main/resources/application.yml`.

### Changing the Execution Mode

Find this section in the file:

```yaml
executor:
  mode: local    # Change to 'docker' for Docker mode
```

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `local` | **Default.** Code runs directly on your computer. Faster but less secure. |
| `docker` | Code runs inside Docker containers. Slower but isolated and safer. |

### Changing the Port

The app runs on port **8081** by default. To change it:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8081    # Change this number
```

## 🧪 Sample Problems Included

The app comes with 5 practice problems:

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Description |
|---|---------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Two Sum | Easy | Add two numbers |
| 2 | Palindrome Check | Easy | Check if a string reads the same forwards and backwards |
| 3 | FizzBuzz | Easy | Classic programming exercise |
| 4 | Factorial | Medium | Calculate n! |
| 5 | Prime Number Check | Medium | Determine if a number is prime |

## 💻 Supported Languages

| Language | Windows Command | Linux/Mac Command |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Python | `python` | `python3` |
| Java | `javac` & `java` | `javac` & `java` |
| C++ | `g++` | `g++` |
| JavaScript | `node` | `node` |
| C | `gcc` | `gcc` |

**Note:** The app automatically detects your OS and uses the correct commands!

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Local Mode
- ⚠️ Code runs directly on your machine
- ⚠️ Not recommended for untrusted code
- ✅ Great for personal practice

### Docker Mode
- ✅ Code runs in isolated containers
- ✅ Network is disabled (code can't access internet)
- ✅ Memory and CPU limits applied
- ✅ Safer for running untrusted code

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues

**"'python' is not recognized"**
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation
- Restart your terminal after installation

**"'g++' is not recognized"**
- Install MinGW-w64 from [mingw-w64.org](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
- Add `C:\mingw64\bin` to your PATH environment variable

### Linux/Mac Issues

**"Port 8081 already in use"**
```bash
# Kill the process using port 8081
fuser -k 8081/tcp   # Linux
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill  # macOS

# Then try again
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**"python3: command not found"**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install python3

# macOS
brew install python3
```

### Docker Issues

**"Docker: permission denied" (Linux)**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then log out and log back in
```

**Docker not starting (Windows)**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Check that WSL2 is properly installed

### Java Issues

**"Compilation Error" when submitting Java**

Make sure your class is named `Main`:
```java
public class Main {  // ✅ Must be named Main
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // your code
    }
}
```

## 🤝 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

```
You write code    →    Server receives it    →    Code runs in sandbox
      ↑                                                    ↓
      └────────────────  Result sent back  ←──────────────┘
```

1. **You submit code** through the web interface
2. **Server saves** your submission to the database
3. **Code executor** (local or Docker) runs your code
4. Your code gets **test inputs** and produces **outputs**
5. **Outputs are compared** with expected results
6. You see **ACCEPTED** if all tests pass, or an error otherwise
